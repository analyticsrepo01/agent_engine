# Agent Engine Tutorials and Examples

This repository contains comprehensive tutorials and examples for building, deploying, and evaluating AI agents using Google Cloud's Vertex AI Agent Engine. The tutorials cover multiple frameworks and approaches for creating sophisticated AI applications.

## Overview

Vertex AI Agent Engine is a managed service that helps you build and deploy agent frameworks at scale. This repository demonstrates three different approaches to agent development:

1. **CrewAI with Evaluation** - Building and comprehensively evaluating CrewAI agents
2. **LangGraph Integration** - Creating stateful, multi-actor applications with workflow orchestration
3. **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** - Simplified agent creation and deployment
